    <p>The Masquerave Podcast is a regular podcast by Prague-based UK bass DJ and producer <a href="http://z-kat.bandcamp.com">Z-Kat</a> that aims to showcase the best new music from the bass scene.</p>
<p>Masquerave began as a monthly podcast in December 2014 in which Z-Kat played a mix of the hottest tunes of the last month, often accompanied by a guest mix or feature mix with a theme. Each podcast also featured a &ldquo;release of the month&rdquo; which celebrated the one EP or album from the last month&rsquo;s selection which excelled the most in the now dying art of making a good release (as opposed to simply a collection of good tracks).</p>
<p>The podcast ran in this format for 50 episodes until January 2019, and featured guest mixes from many exciting artists from the UK and Czech music scenes and beyond. Masquerave also played a hand in organising a few events in Prague during this time with guests such as Thorpey, Sample Junkie and Detrivore. After a long hiatus, the podcast has finally been revived and as of December 2022 runs once every three months, with a focus on new music released on Bandcamp.</p>
<p>Episodes from before 2022 are uploaded to <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/zkat/">Mixcloud</a> and episodes from 2022 onwards are uploaded to <a href="https://hearthis.at/z-kat/">hearthis.at</a>. All of them can be streamed directly from masquerave.cz.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ever stop the hype!</p>

What is the meaning of life? Some say 42, others say gully riddims full of filthy bass. Z-Kat has plenty of that in his roundup of the tunes of the last month, which is followed by a long-awaited guest mix from Danka, with a slightly calmer and funkier groove to get you ready for the summer.

**Date**: May 2018  
**Length**: 1:18:09  
**Guest**: Danka  
**Release of the month**: Petey Clicks – Club Heads EP [Night Bass]
